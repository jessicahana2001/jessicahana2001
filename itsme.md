ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jessica Hana Christy Sitompul. Iâ€™m currently majoring Computer Science at Binus University and having Database Technology as my stream course. I have learned some programming languages such as C, Java, Phyton, PHP, Javascript. Besides programming languages, i also have learned many things about Database.

I have an interest to be part of Data Scientist . It is because i love to do a research on how tiny thing such as data can make a big impact on something, especially in business.
